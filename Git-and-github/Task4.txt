What Is GitHub?
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

In GitHub, we can invite other GitHub users to become collaborators to our private repositories(which expires after 7 days if not accepted, restoring any unclaimed licenses). Being a collaborator, of a personal repository you can pull (read) the contents of the repository and push (write) changes to the repository. You can add unlimited collaborators on public and private repositories(with some per day limit restrictions). But, in a private repository, the owner of the repo can only grant write-access to the collaborators, and they can’t have the read-only access.


Actions that can be Performed By Collaborators
Collaborators can perform a number of actions into someone else’s personal repositories, they have gained access to. Some of them are, 

Create, merge, and close pull requests in the repository
Publish, view, install the packages
Fork the repositories
Make the changes on the repositories as suggested by the Pull requests.
Mark issues or pull requests as duplicate
Create, edit, and delete any comments on commits, pull requests, and issues in the repository
Removing themselves as collaborators on the repositories.
Manage releases in the repositories
